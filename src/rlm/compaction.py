Summarize only the work since the most recent compaction block: everything after the last

Earlier history is already preserved above at decreasing resolution and must not be restated.
Preserve what is needed to resume accurately:
- The user's objective, exact requirements, constraints, and unresolved decisions.
- Completed work, evidence/results, important paths or sources, and remaining next steps.
- Ongoing orchestration: child names/IDs, assignments and pending follow-ups; Bash job IDs,
  commands and last-known outcomes; subscriptions/targets; unread or retrieved events still
  requiring action; output cursors and useful history message/window references.
- Any interrupted or uncertain operation and side effects that must be inspected before retrying.

Include runnable commands, test filters, or concrete edits when relevant and known.
Use only APIs/tools actually available; do not invent edits, results, resource IDs, or state.
Distinguish last-observed state from assumptions: background work may progress during compaction.
If resources are no longer needed, note that they can be cancelled; do not imply they were cancelled.

Summarize from the existing conversation. Do not call tools. Reply with the summary as plain text."""
